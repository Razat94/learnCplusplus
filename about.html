				This website was created to explain the basics of C++.
				You don't need to have any prior programming experience to understand chapters written on this site.
				Just read the pages and try your best to follow along.
			</p>

			<p>
				I created this website for the full purpose of teaching C++.
				Some of the examples listed in this site is based off if not completely copied off other websites.
				I've tried my best to give credits to each respective resource at the bottom of each chapter.
				Again, this site is a non-profit; I'm not interested in making any revenue from it.
			</p>

				Although you probably don't need any publications to understand the fundamentals of C++,
				if you insist on learning C++  from a textbook,
				I highly recommend you check out 
				<a href = "http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html">Stroustrups "Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++" (Second Edition) Textbook</a>.
				It's a fantastic book that explains C++ better than I can, so please check it out. 
			</p>
