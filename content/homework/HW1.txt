A type tells the program how to interpret a value in memory.
We declare three double variables called radius, circumference and area. 
A double variable, unlike int, can hold real number (or floating-point number) such as 1.23 or 4.5e6. 
We also declare a "constant" double variable called PI, whose value cannot be changed, and initialize its value to 3.14159265.


Exercises (Chapter 1)
Write programs called PrintPatternX.cpp (where X from A to D) to print EACH of the following patterns. Use one "cout <<" for each line of outputs. End each line by printing an "endl".
