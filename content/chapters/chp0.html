			<p>
				To write a computer program, we must first know <i>what</i> is a program. 
				A computer program is a series of steps that is executed by a computer. 
				A computer program can be:

				<li>An operating system.</li>
				<li>A web browser like Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari</li>
				<li>An office suite used to write documents or spreadsheets.</li>
				<li>A video game</li>
				<li>...what you will be coding!</li>
				<a href = "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">Source*</a>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As you may guess, a computer program is written by a programmer. 
				In other words, the programmer (you!) would be typing (i.e. coding) out the steps (the program) for the computer to execute.
				
				To write a program, a programmer needs to write the source code in the programming language of their choosing (in our case, C++).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To learn programming, you will first need:
				<p>
					<li>a computer</li>
					<li>a compiler</li>
				</p>
				Every programmer needs a computer to type the code on, and a compiler to compile the C++ code. 
				The latter half might lead you to the next question: <strong>What is a compiler??</strong> 
			</p>

			<p> 
				To understand what a compiler does, we must first understand how do computers operate.
				Computers are fairly stupid; they can only understand machine code (i.e. machine language), which is a set of instructions consisting of ones and zeros.
			</p>

			<p> A single instruction to a computer could look like this: </p>
			<div class="jumbotron" style = "margin-bottom: 1rem;">
				<p>
					00000	10011110
				</p>
			</div>
			<a href = "http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/">Source*</a>
		
			<p>
				A computer program written in the ones and zeroes would be difficult to read and understand by us humans.  
				Instead, computer programmers choose to keep their sanity by writing source code in a programming language, such as C++, 
				and run a program called a compiler to try and translate the language into something the computer can understand.
			</p>

			<p>
				In short, when you write a program in C++, 
				you would execute (or run) your code by running another program (the compiler) that translates your C++ source code into machine code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything covered in this section may seem confusing as first.
				But as time goes on, you will begin to understand it all better.  
			</p>

			<p>
				There are many different ways to compile a C++ program. 
				The simplest way to compile it is by using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
				An IDE contains several tools needed for development, such as a text editor and tools needed to compile programs directly.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I personally really love
				<a href = "http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html">Dev-C++</a>.

				Another official IDE is
				<a href = "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you are able to run the IDE, you are ready to start programming! :)
