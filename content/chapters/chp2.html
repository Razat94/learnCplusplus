			</ul>

			<h1 style = "text-align: center;"> Data Types </h1>
			
			<p> In the last chapter, we wrote our first computer program that outputted the text "Hello, World!" upon execution.</p>

			<p>
				As you may know, computer allocates memory to programs in bits. 
				Programs can use different types of bits to represent data.
				Different type sizes can have different bit sizes; the more bits a type has, the more distinct values it can represent, but at the same time, also consumes more space in memory.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we outputted the sentence "Hello, World", we outputted a string.
				A string is a type of data that refers to a string of characters.
				The string data type is just one of many data type.
				Different data types can do different things.
				For now, we'll just focus on outputting different types of data to the console window.
				In this chapter, we will go over what is in my opinion the five most essential data types in C++, which are:  </p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>int</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>double</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>char</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>string</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>bool</i>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Let's now go over each data type in detail.
			</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>int</i>
					<iframe src="../programs/chapter2/chp2-00.cpp" class = "xsmallRem codeBoxBorder" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<iframe src="../programs/chapter2/chp2-00.txt" class = "xxsmallRem textBoxBorder" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<p>
					As you may guess, int simply stands for 'integer'.
					In normal mathematics, integers are known as whole numbers 
					i.e. numbers without a fractional component. 
					In C++, this concept is a bit different.
					In programming, the int data type is represented by 32 bit memory.
					<br>
					You can visualize this number by thinking of 32 individual bits.
					Each bit can be "on" (1) or "off" (0), and because there are 32 bits in an int value,
					the total number would be 2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296 (~4 billion).
					It is important to keep in mind that we must include negative numbers and the number 0.
					Thus, the values for the int data type can only go up to +2147483647 & -2147483648.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>double</i>
					<p>
						This type represents real values, such as integers AND decimal numbers.
						It generally is an integer followed by “.” and Integer, e.g., 123.00
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>char</i>
					<p>
						This type represents a single character, such as 'Y', 'N' or '@'. 
						This character represents a byte of information. 		
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>string</i>
					<p>
						As you may guess, the string data type represents a string of characters.
						We can use strings like so:
						cout << "Hello " + "World"
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>bool</i>
					
					<p>
						Boolean types can simply represent true or false; 1 or 0. 
						We use the <i>true</i> and <i>false</i> keywords <strong>without</strong> 
						quotation marks to represent boolean values!
						A <mark>keyword</mark> is a reserved word in C++.
						We will go over it again in the next chapter.
					</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Although there are different data types, we must be careful when dealing and comparing data types.
				You can add two strings together: 
					<br> cout << "Hello " + "World!";
				<br> <br> & you can add two integers together:
					<br> cout << 3 + 4;
				<br> <br> But if I try adding two different data tyles like so: cout << ( 3 + "Hello World" ); 
				I should of course get an error.
				Does it make any sense to add "Hello World!" to the integer three?
				<br> <br>
				Although the last example was a bit intuitive, it can help answer the next question: 
				Does it make any sense to add 3 & "4" together? Like so: cout << 3 + "4"; The answer to that is no as well.
			</p>

			<h3> Identifiers & Keywords </h3>
			<p>
				Lastly,
				you might ask yourself: What is the difference between a keyword and an identifier?
			</p>
			<p>
				Keywords a.k.a. reserved words are basically words that have a specific ( or reserved ) meaning to them.

				So for example, all data types are keywords. 
				Please note that if you mispell a keyword, then your program won't run. 
				I repeat: 
			</p>

			<div class="jumbotron alert-danger">
				<p>
					Note: YOU CAN NOT MISPELL A KEYWORD IF YOU WISH TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Identifiers are a sequence of letters or digits, however, 
				the first character must be a letter and last char must be
				either $ or letter. Upper and lower cases are same. 
				They can consist of variables, functions, etc.
				We'll note this again in the following chapters.
			</p>

			<p>
				Like stated above, some identifiers are reserved for use as keywords, and may not be used otherwise:
				e.g., int, if, else, endif, while, return, get, put etc.
